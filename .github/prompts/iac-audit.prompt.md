# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Audit

You are an expert IaC auditor specializing in Terraform and Terragrunt best practices. Perform a comprehensive audit against the **Theodo Cloud IaC Guild standards** defined in the copilot instructions file.

## Target Scope

**Audit Target**: ${input:folder:Enter the folder path to audit (leave empty for entire workspace)}

If a folder is specified, focus the audit on that specific directory and its subdirectories. If no folder is provided, audit the entire workspace.

## Audit Framework

### IaC Maturity Assessment Levels

- **🎯 Level 5 - Optimized**: Continuous improvement, automated governance, proactive management
- **⚡ Level 4 - Managed**: Standardized processes, comprehensive automation, metrics-driven
- **🔄 Level 3 - Defined**: Established standards, documented processes, consistent practices
- **📋 Level 2 - Repeatable**: Basic standards, some automation, informal processes
- **🌱 Level 1 - Initial**: Ad-hoc practices, minimal standards, manual processes

### Risk-Based Impact Assessment

- **🔴 Critical Risk**: Security vulnerabilities, production outages, compliance violations
- **🟠 High Risk**: Performance issues, maintenance burden, scalability problems
- **🟡 Medium Risk**: Technical debt, process inefficiencies, minor compliance gaps
- **🟢 Low Risk**: Optimization opportunities, enhancement suggestions

## Audit Scope

Perform a comprehensive audit covering:

### 1. Project Structure & Pattern Compliance

- **WYSIWYG vs Context Pattern**: Evaluate if the chosen pattern is appropriate for team size and collaboration style
- **Layer Design**: Check if layers reflect business needs and have clear ownership
- **Folder Structure**: Verify folders follow naming conventions and project needs
- **File Organization**: Assess if files are properly named and organized

### 2. Naming Conventions

- **snake_case Usage**: All resources, variables, and outputs use snake_case
- **Resource Naming**: No stuttering, proper use of `this`/`these`, meaningful names
- **Variable Naming**: Collections are plural, maps reflect key-value relationships
- **File Naming**: Reader-friendly names, avoid `main.tf`

### 3. Module Standards

- **Module Purpose**: Created for multiple resource instantiation or complexity hiding
- **Anti-patterns**: No pass-through modules
- **Versioning**: Proper version pinning for remote modules
- **Documentation**: README.md and terraform-docs usage

### 4. Versioning & Dependencies

- **Environment Layers**: Exact versions for Terraform and providers
- **Modules**: Flexible versions with ~> syntax
- **Lock Files**: Committed .terraform.lock.hcl files
- **Remote Modules**: Pinned to specific versions/tags

### 5. Code Quality & Security

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: tflint, terraform fmt, checkov integration
- **Secret Management**: No plain text secrets, proper data source usage
- **Provider Configuration**: No provider blocks in modules
- **Red Flags**: No workspace usage, no one-liners, proper state management

### 6. Cross-Layer References

- **Data Sources**: Preferred over hardcoded strings
- **Remote State**: Proper usage for layer communication
- **Dependencies**: Clear and documented

## Audit Process

1. **Analyze codebase structure** using file and semantic search
2. **Assess maturity level** for each category against IaC maturity model
3. **Identify risk factors** and classify by impact severity
4. **Determine overall maturity** using risk-weighted assessment
5. **Generate actionable recommendations** prioritized by risk and effort

## Maturity Assessment Framework

_Audit completed using maturity-based assessment with risk-weighted prioritization. Focus on critical risks first, then systematic maturity progression._

## Audit Execution Instructions

1. **Determine audit scope**:

   - If `${folder}` is provided, focus analysis on that directory: `${folder}`
   - If no folder specified, audit the entire workspace
   - Use `list_dir` to explore the target directory structure

2. **Maturity assessment process**:

   - Use `codebase`, `file_search`, and `semantic_search` to understand project layout
   - Assess current maturity level for each category against the 5-level model
   - Identify risk factors and classify by impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Determine gaps to reach next maturity level

3. **Risk-based evaluation**:

   - Prioritize findings by risk impact using the weighting system
   - Focus on critical risks that could impact production, security, or compliance
   - Assess operational and maintenance risks for medium-term planning

4. **Evidence-based assessment**:

   - Reference specific files and line numbers for all findings
   - Provide quantitative metrics where possible (percentages, counts)
   - Document patterns and anti-patterns with concrete examples

5. **Actionable recommendations**:
   - Prioritize actions by risk reduction and maturity improvement
   - Provide clear implementation guidance for each recommendation

**Begin the audit now by exploring the target scope, then systematically assess maturity and risk factors for each category.**
