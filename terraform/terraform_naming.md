# Terraform Naming Guidelines

## `use_snake_case_0nly`

All resource or variable names in Terraform code must be written in `snake_case`.
This means allowed characters are lowercase alphanumeric characters, with `_`
separators when needed.

Why ?

- it is the standard in the terraform ecosystem
- not following the standard can cause confusion in the team and slow down
  onboarding

> Note : Beware that actual cloud resources often have restrictions in allowed
> names. Some resources, for example, can't contain dashes, some must be
> camelCased. The conventions in this document refer to Terraform names
> themselves.

## Resource and/or data source naming

- Avoid stuttering when naming Terraform resources.

  ```terraform
  resource "aws_route_table" "public" {}                 # <- ðŸŸ¢ no stuttering
  resource "aws_route_table" "public_route_table" {}     # <- ðŸ”´ stuttering
  resource "aws_route_table" "public_aws_route_table" {} # <- ðŸ”´ maximum stuttering
  ```

- Name a resource `this` if there is no more descriptive and general name available, or if the resource is part of a module that creates a single resource of this type. For example, in a `terraform-google-bucket` module :

  ```terraform
  resource "google_storage_bucket" "this" {
    name = var.name
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Name a resource `these` if there is no more descriptive and general name available, or if the resource is part of a module that creates multiple resources of this type. For example, in a `terraform-google-bucket` module :

  ```terraform
  resource "google_storage_bucket" "these" {
    for_each = toset(var.names)
    name = each.value
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Resource and module instance names should be singular if they represent only one instance and should be plural in the case you loop over them with `for_each` or `for`.

  ```terraform
  module "bucket" {
    source   = "github.com/padok-team/terraform-google-bucket"

    name = "frontend"
  }
  ```

  ```terraform
  module "buckets" {
    source   = "github.com/padok-team/terraform-google-bucket"
    for_each = toset([0, 1, 2])

    name = "bucket-${each.key}"
  }
  ```

## Variables

- Variable names for **collections** (sets, lists and maps) must be plural.

- Variable names for **maps** should reflect the usage of the map. The relationship between the key and values should be obvious based on the name.

  ```terraform
  locals {
    role_by_contributor = {
      "arthurb@padok.fr"   = "Viewer"
      "antoinec@padok.fr"  = "Editor"
      "benjamins@padok.fr" = "Admin"
    }
  }
  ```

  In the example above, `role_by_contributor` is much clearer than `contributor_roles`.
  It also breaks any ambiguity around the number of roles per contributor.
  In the example above the name of variable indicates that each contributor has a single role.
  If contributors had multiple roles each, the variable name should be `roles_by_contributor`.
  `contributor_roles` is ambiguous about the plurality of roles per contributor.

- Avoid repeating yourself within a variable's name.

  ```terraform
  variable "s3_storage_bucket_name" # <- ðŸ”´ too precise
  variable "bucket"                 # <- ðŸ”´ not precise enough
  variable "bucket_name"            # <- ðŸŸ¢ seems like a good compromise
  ```

- Always provide a variable's description, even if it seems obvious to you.

  ```terraform
  variable "tags" {
    description = "A mapping of tags to assign to the resource."
    type        = map(string)
  }
  ```

Do not reinvent the wheel when naming variables or writing descriptions. If a
variable is consumed by a resource or module directly and you don't need any sort
of abstraction, reuse the variable name from the "**Argument Reference**" section
in the resource's (or module's) documentation.

```terraform
module "bucket" {
  source   = "github.com/padok-team/terraform-google-bucket"

  name = "frontend"
  storage_class = local.storage_class

  tags = local.tags
}
```

If your module is abstracting resource variables in any way, you should find a nam that best suits
your parameter.

```terraform
module "private_bucket" {
  source   = "github.com/padok-team/terraform-google-bucket"

  name = local.name
  private = true
}
module "public_bucket" {
  source   = "github.com/padok-team/terraform-google-bucket"

  name = local.name
  private = false
}
```

## Module outputs

Naming module outputs properly is important for them to be consistent through
your codebase, and for them to be understandable outside of their immediate
context. From a user's perspective, it should be trivial what type each
attribute has.

- If the output is a **list** its name must be plural.

- If the output is a **map** its name must obviously relates on key / value pairs.

- Always provide an output's description, even if it seems obvious to you.

  ```terraform
  output "this" {
    description = "The AKS resource."
    value       = data.azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.this
  }
  ```

- Example of a module that instanciates a Function App, a Storage Account and an App Insights. The module is called `azurerm-function-app`.

  ```terraform
  output "this" {
    description = "The Function App resource."
    value       = module.function_app.this
  }

  output "app_insights" {
    description = "The Application Insights resource."
    value       = module.application_insights.this
  }

  output "storage_account" {
    description = "The Storage Account resource."
    value       = module.storage_account.this
  }
  ```
